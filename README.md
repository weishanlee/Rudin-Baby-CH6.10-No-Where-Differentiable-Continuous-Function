# Rudin CH6.10 NoWhereDiffContinuousFunction
The repository is intended to draw the function decribed Baby Rudin (P.154, 3rd, Ed.). 
Define $ \phi(x) = |x| $ for $ -1 \leq x \leq 1 $. Extend to all real $x$ by defining periodically $ \phi(x+2) =\phi(x) $.
Define $ f(x)=\sum\limits_{i=0}^{\infty} \frac{3}{4}^{n}\phi(4^nx) $.
Please double check if my plot is correct. Plot the nowhere differentiable continuous function in Rudin Exericise CH6.10.
Also, the program takes long time for large n. Is there any way that we can improve it?
