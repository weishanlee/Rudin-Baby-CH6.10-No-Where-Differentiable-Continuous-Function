# Rudin CH6.10 NoWhereDiffContinuousFunction
The repository is intended to draw the nowhere-differentiable continuous function, decribed in Exericise CH6.10 in Baby Rudin (P.154, 3rd, Ed.). The function is constructed by defining $ \phi(x) = |x| $ for $ -1 \leq x \leq 1 $. And Extend to all real $x$ by the periodicity $ \phi(x+2) =\phi(x) $. Further, define $ f(x)=\sum\limits_{i=0}^{\infty} (\frac{3}{4})^{n}\phi(4^nx) $.
Please double check if my plot is correct.
Also, the program takes long time for large n. Is there any way that we can improve it?
